## Extended polymerfire with the latest features

Due to having to make use of projectId in <firebase-app>, I've seen the need to "fast-forward" a bower package of the newest commits to this project.

This project will hopefully be alive until polymerfire team releases these features of their own, but until then these newest commits will be available in this package.

bower install p-updated-polymerfire
